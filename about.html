        	<h3>OUR BEGGININGS</h3>
    Manav Vikas Sanstha, the organization was established in the year 2016. As the name suggests, human development is the development of human beings with the same objective. One thing we have been hearing and saying since India became independent is that India is a developing country and at the same time we have always been comparing India with other developed countries. Prashant Patodekar, however, thought deeply about why India is not developed and why it is developing. With this thought, a revolutionary organization was formed.<br/><br/>

Academic progress in India seems to be slowing down and even then the curriculum taught in schools is only related to literacy. But not every student will be proficient in this subject. But apart from studies, if students get various artistic or professional knowledge, then India will definitely become a superpower.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

    		<h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
    Shri Manav Vikas Charitable Trust is a national nonprofit that works to close opportunity gaps that disproportionately affect students of color and students from low-income families. Through our research and advocacy, Shri Manav Vikas Trust supports efforts that expand excellence and equity in education from preschool.<br/><br/><br/>
